## Solving for the Future of Cognitive Engineering

Task:
Create a simple Python script using Boto3 that creates a python "layer" and a lambda service to test the layer.

Context:
I have been working with AWS services and specifically using the boto3 Python Library to create various instances and to execute transactions with these instances. I am a bit stuck on how to create lambda layers that work fine without error. If you can help me solve this, I will be grateful.

What I have done so far: 
I understand now how to create simple Lambda Functions and S3 buckets from exclusively Python code (via boto3) and I donâ€™t have any dependency on the AWS UI, besides creating the AIM accounts. Currently, the problem I am having is in how to create a Layer that includes requests. I keep getting errors and ChatGPT has hit a wall. 

Example Code:
See the "Tutorials section of this repo and go to "".

Next Objectives:
(a) Create a Layer programmatically using only a Python script and the boto3 library.
(b) This layer should include 5 libraries: requests, numpy, pandas, openai, and transformers.
(c) This python script to create the layer should be robust and compatible to be run from a Mac machine.
(d) Attach the Layer (programmatically) to a Lambda Function.
(e) Have the Lambda function return a payload that confirms that the Python Library imports were successful.
(f) Send me the python script so I can test it on my machine with my AWS credentials.

It will be a huge un-lock for me if we can solve this.
